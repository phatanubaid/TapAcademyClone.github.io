# TapAcademyClone.github.io
An HTML-only static clone of the TAP Academy official website, designed to replicate its structure, layout, and navigation. This project serves as a learning exercise to practice HTML coding skills by building a functional, lightweight version of the educational platform without the use of CSS or JavaScript.
