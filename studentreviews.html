             A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team. <br>
             I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined <br>
             Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey <br>
              with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are <br>
              skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in <br>
               learning programming languages from scratch. <br><br>

               I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap <br> 
               Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all <br>
               domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the <br>
                trainers. <br><br>

Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package <br>
of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job. <br><br>

Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this <br>
 opportunity.

            <p align="justify">After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and <br>
                my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the <br>
                Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel. <br><br>

                Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. <br>
                 Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos.  <br>
                  They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, <br>
                   Data Structures, etc. <br><br>
                
                I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate <br>
                Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA. <br><br>

            Enrolling at TAP Academy Institute has been one of the best <br>
             decisions for my educational and professional growth. The <br>
             institute offers a holistic learning environment that caters to <br>
              various aspects of my development as a student and aspiring <br>
              professional. <br><br>
            
            The teachers at TAP Academy are incredibly knowledgeable and <br>
            always willing to help. Their dedication to student success is <br>
             evident in the personalized attention they provide. Whenever I <br>
             faced challenges, I knew I could rely on my instructors to offer <br>
             guidance and support, making the learning process smoother <br>
              and more enjoyable. <br><br>
            
            One of the standout features of TAP Academy is the TAI platform, <br>
             dedicated to coding practice. This platform has been <br>
             instrumental in enhancing my programming skills. LMS at TAP <br>
             Academy  is another great asset. It centralizes all learning <br>
              materials, assignments, and progress tracking in one place. The <br>
              dedicated job portal connects students with potential employers, <br>
              offering a direct pathway to internships and job placements. <br>
               Through this portal, I have had the opportunity to apply my skills <br>
                in a professional setting, which has been crucial for my career  <br>
                development. </p>

    <p>I'm a student from the Feb 2 batch, and I'm happy to share my <br>
         experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in Tamil <br>
         Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, offering a free <br>
          course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to other <br>
           academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent trainers, <br>

            start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to understand, <br>
            and provide in-depth coverage of programming and OOPS <br>
            concepts, highly valuable for placement opportunities. I'm <br>

            Engineer with a package of 5 LPA through college placement, <br>
            and I attribute my success to Tap Academy's incredible teaching, <br>
             as I used the same approach they taught me during them mock <br>
              interview process. Additionally, Tap Academy offers <br>
               comprehensive notebooks and study materials, an LMS platform <br>
               with daily class recordings, a TAl platform for practicing daily <br>
                programming questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock <br>
                 assessments and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, as <br>
